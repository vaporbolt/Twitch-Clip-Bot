# Twitch-Clip-Bot

A bot that compiles clips from any category or user on twitch.tv and compile them into a video and uploads them on youtube! While the code here is very dated(hard coded file paths, old API calls, etc) This project was instramental in how I learned to organize dependencies and leverage APIs. Thus, the repo will stay as a reminder of where I began in my software career.
